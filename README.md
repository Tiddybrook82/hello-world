  <p>Please do note the following</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The "food" will be delivered by a spotty young youth driving a vehicle with an excessively noisey exhaust and playing "banging" tunes</li>
    <li>Said food will likely arrive cold and stodgy</li>
    <li>By utilising this delivery service you are simply highlighting the depths to which this capitalistic world has plunged to when you can't even be arsed to wander down to your nearest Mcdonald's or perhaps cook yourself up a healthy option</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>To combat this please utilise the following</p>
